---

#### **2.3.2. Dependencies**

Spring Initializr provides a wide range of dependencies to add to your project. Below are descriptions of some common dependencies you may choose:

#### **2.3.2.1. Spring Web**
- **Description**: This dependency is used for building web applications and RESTful web services. It includes Spring MVC and embedded servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow. You’ll typically include this in applications that need web support (e.g., a REST API, a server-side web app, etc.).

#### **2.3.2.2. Spring Data JPA**
- **Description**: This dependency provides support for integrating with relational databases using Java Persistence API (JPA). It simplifies database operations and makes it easier to interact with relational databases using repository patterns. Typically used in applications where you need to perform CRUD operations on relational databases.

#### **2.3.2.3. MySQL Driver**
- **Description**: The MySQL Driver dependency provides the necessary drivers to connect your Spring Boot application to a MySQL database. If you're using MySQL for your application's data storage, you'll need this driver to facilitate database communication.

#### **2.3.2.4. Spring Boot DevTools**
- **Description**: Spring Boot DevTools enhances the development experience by providing additional features like automatic restarts, live reload, and debugging tools. It is specifically useful during the development phase as it speeds up the testing and debugging cycle by reloading your application upon changes.

#### **2.3.2.5. Lombok**
- **Description**: Lombok is a library that automatically generates commonly used code, such as getters, setters, `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods, constructors, etc., by annotating your classes with special annotations. This helps reduce boilerplate code and improves the readability of your application, especially when working with POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).

#### **2.3.2.6. Spring Boot**
- **Description**: This is the core dependency for Spring Boot applications. It includes essential features such as auto-configuration, embedded servers (like Tomcat, Jetty), and starters (pre-configured, ready-to-use components) that make it easier to set up and run Spring applications with minimal configuration. It is the foundation of your Spring Boot project.

---

#### **2.4. Packaging**

When generating a Spring Boot project, you can choose between two types of packaging:

- **2.4.1. Jar**:
  - JAR (Java Archive) is the most common packaging format for Spring Boot applications. It can be run on any platform with the appropriate JVM. It contains the compiled classes, libraries, resources, and metadata required to run the application.

- **2.4.2. War**:
  - WAR (Web Archive) packaging is used when you want to deploy your application to a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat). You may use WAR packaging when your application is designed to be deployed on traditional web servers.

---

#### **2.5. Java Version**

  - **2.5.1. Java 17** (LTS)

---

#### **2.6. Spring Initializr in IDEs**

Most popular IDEs support **Spring Initializr** for creating Spring Boot projects directly from the IDE. Here’s how you can use it in the most popular IDEs:

#### **2.6.1. IntelliJ IDEA:**
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click on **Create New Project**.
3. Choose **Spring Initializr** from the left sidebar.
4. Configure the project metadata and dependencies as described above.
5. Click **Next** and finish the setup.
6. IntelliJ IDEA will generate the project and import it into your workspace.

#### **2.6.2. Eclipse:**
1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Go to **File > New > Project**.
3. Select **Spring Starter Project** under the Spring category.
4. Fill in the project metadata and choose dependencies.
5. Click **Finish** to generate the project.

#### **2.6.3. Visual Studio Code:**
1. Install the **Spring Initializr** extension from the marketplace.
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for **Spring Initializr: Generate a Maven Project**.
3. Follow the prompts to select project metadata and dependencies.
4. The project will be generated and opened in VS Code.

---

#### **2.7. How Spring Initializr Works**

When you configure your project and click **Generate**, Spring Initializr:

1. Collects the metadata and dependencies you selected.
2. Generates the necessary project structure, including:
   - **`pom.xml`** or **`build.gradle`** (depending on the selected build tool).
   - **`application.properties`** or **`application.yml`** for application configuration.
   - The **main class** (e.g., `DemoApplication.java`) containing the `main()` method to run the Spring Boot application.
3. Zips the project into a downloadable archive.
4. You can extract the archive and open the project in your IDE.

Spring Initializr also supports generating projects with specific versions of Spring Boot, making it compatible with various Spring Boot versions.

### About `package.json`:

A `package.json` file is a fundamental component in Node.js projects. It serves as a metadata file for the project and contains important information about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.

#### Key Uses of `package.json`

1. **Project Metadata:**
   - **Name:** The name of your project or application.
   - **Version:** The version number of your project.
   - **Description:** A short description of your project.
   - **Author:** The person or organization responsible for the project.
   - **License:** Specifies the license under which the project is released.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - **Dependencies:** External libraries or packages required to run the application.
   - **DevDependencies:** Libraries needed only for development (e.g., testing frameworks, bundlers).
   - **PeerDependencies:** Specifies versions of other packages your package is compatible with.

3. **Scripts:**
   Define custom scripts that can be run using `npm run <script-name>`. Examples:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node server.js",
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```

4. **Package Management:**
   - Running `npm install` uses the `package.json` file to install the listed dependencies.
   - Ensures consistency of dependencies across environments.

5. **Version Control:**
   - Tracks versions of dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.

#### **Key Commands Involving `package.json`:**
- `npm init`: Initializes a new Node.js project and creates a `package.json` file.
- `npm install`: Installs dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
- `npm run <script>`: Executes the script defined in `package.json`.

### Front-End Portnumber

#### 1. Purpose of the Port Configuration
The frontend of this project is built using React. By default, React runs on port 3000 during development. This documentation provides guidelines for developers to ensure that the React development server consistently uses port 3000, even if other processes might attempt to occupy this port.

#### 2. Project Port Requirements
This project is designed to run only on port 3000 during development. React's development server will be configured to always use port 3000, and developers should ensure no other services are using this port. If the port is already occupied, React will throw an error, and you will need to free up the port.

`http://localhost:3000`

- **Port Conflict:** If port 3000 is already in use by another application, you will need to free up the port or modify the configuration to use a different one.
- **Firewall Issues:** Ensure that your firewall or network settings are configured to allow traffic on port 3000 for local development.

This command launches the development server, which watches for changes to your project files and automatically reloads the browser when changes are detected.

### CSS - Tailwind, Bootstrap

#### 7.1 Tailwind CSS
<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" >Tailwind</a> CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, which can greatly speed up the development process. It allows you to apply styles directly in your JSX, reducing the need to switch between CSS and JavaScript files.

#### The Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`)

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/*/.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: 'var(--primary-color)', // Use CSS variable for the primary color
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

#### Key Features of Tailwind CSS:

- **Utility-First:** Use pre-made classes in HTML/JSX for styling (e.g., padding, colors) instead of custom CSS.
- **Customizability:** Easily adjust Tailwind settings to fit your project's unique design.
- **Responsive Design:** Simplifies creating designs that work on different screen sizes using classes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`.
- **No Pre-made UI:** Gives you full control to design your UI without predefined components.
  
#### Example

```js
import React from 'react';

function Button() {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700">
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}

export default Button;
```

#### In this example:

- `px-4` adds padding to the left and right of the button.
- `py-2` adds padding to the top and bottom.
- `bg-blue-500` sets the background color.
- `text-white` makes the text color white.
- `rounded-lg` applies rounded corners.
- `hover:bg-blue-700` changes the background color on hover.
  
#### 7.2 Bootstrap

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a popular open-source front-end framework that provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript tools for building responsive, mobile-first websites. It was originally developed by Twitter and is now one of the most widely used frameworks in web development.

The following two lines of code are used to import Bootstrap styles and JavaScript functionality into a React project:

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js';
```
#### Example

```js
import React from 'react';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1 className="text-center text-primary">Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>
      <p className="text-muted">This is a simple example of Bootstrap styling in React.</p>
      <button className="btn btn-success">Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
#### Component Use:

- `container`: Centers the content with padding.
- `text-center`: Centers the text.
- `text-primary`: Makes the text color blue (Bootstrap's primary color).
- `text-muted`: Makes the text color gray.
- `btn btn-success`: Styles the button with a green background.

### App.jsx 

In a React application, `App.jsx` is a central component file that typically serves as the entry point for rendering the main application. It acts as the root component of your React app and often contains the core structure and layout of the application.

#### Key Points about App.jsx in React:

#### 1. Default Component:

In React apps created with Create React App, `App.jsx` is automatically included as the main component. It is usually rendered by `index.js` and acts as the parent component for other components.

#### 2. Component Structure:

`App.jsx` is a functional or class-based React component. It defines the primary structure of your app and integrates other components.

#### 3. Purpose:

`App.jsx` is typically used to:

- Define the layout and structure of the app.
- Integrate and manage state (often using tools like React's `useState` or `useReducer`).
- Serve as the central hub to load and nest other child components.
- Implement routing using tools like `react-router`.

### Front-End: Component Information

#### 1. Component Purpose and Overview:
The purpose of this component is to manage the Calling Tracker Form functionality. It is responsible for fetching data, submitting new data, and updating the calling tracker. The component also integrates with APIs, handles socket transmissions, and shows success/error notifications to the user.

#### Example Code:

```jsx
// App.jsx
import CallingTrackerForm from "./CallingTrackerForm";
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CallingTrackerForm/> 
    </div>
  );
}
```


#### CallingTrackerForm.jsx

```javascript
try {
     
      
    axios.post(
        ${API_BASE_URL}/calling-tracker/${employeeId}/${userType},
        dataToUpdate,
        {
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
        }

```
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b629ae-9bfe-43f4-a034-79875c882f4a" width="900">

#### Dependencies:

1. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios" target="_blank">Axios</a>: A popular promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

#### Request Body:

2. **dataToUpdate** (Object): This object contains the data to be sent in the request body. The data is typically in JSON format and can include various fields related to the calling tracker (e.g., call count, duration, etc.).

### API Fetching in React

API fetching in React means getting data from an external source, like a server or database, using an API (a way to communicate between systems). When you make a request to an API, you ask for information, and the API sends it back to your React app.

#### Why use API fetching in React?

1. **Get Dynamic Data**: Your app can show real-time data, like the latest news, weather, or user information, by fetching it from an API.
   
2. **Organize Code Better**: The app gets data from a backend (like a server), while React focuses on showing it to users. This keeps your code clean.

3. **Save Data**: You can send or receive data to/from a server. For example, if a user fills out a form, you can send that data to be saved.

4. **Load Data in the Background**: React can fetch data without freezing the page, so users can still interact with the app while the data loads.
   
#### Example of API Fetching

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `${API_BASE_URL}/calling-lineup/${employeeId}/${userType}?searchTerm=${searchTerm}&page=${page}&size=${size}`
);
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
}
```
![Api](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3113931a-1d56-4148-a084-57b9ed51466b)

#### Method

- **fetch**: A native JavaScript function to make HTTP requests. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to the response of the request.

#### Request Format

- The request is made to the calling lineup API endpoint with dynamic segments (`employeeId` and `userType`) as part of the URL.
- Query parameters (`searchTerm`, `page`, `size`) are appended to the URL to provide filtering and pagination capabilities.

### 3. SocketIO

#### 3.1. What is Socket.IO?

**Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients (such as browsers) and servers over **WebSockets** or other protocols. It's often used in applications that require real-time updates, such as messaging apps, live notifications, and multiplayer games.

Socket.IO is built on top of **WebSockets**, but it offers additional features like automatic reconnection, fallback mechanisms (e.g., using long polling when WebSockets are unavailable), and broadcasting, which makes it more reliable and easier to work with compared to raw WebSocket connections.

#### 3.1.1. Key Features of Socket.IO:

3.1.1.1. **Real-time Communication**: Allows real-time, low-latency communication between the server and the client. For example, a message can be sent from the server to the client and vice versa in real-time.
3.1.1.2. **Bi-directional Communication**: Both the client and server can send messages to each other, making it ideal for interactive applications like chat apps or live collaboration tools.
3.1.1.3. **Automatic Reconnection**: Socket.IO automatically tries to reconnect when the connection is lost, ensuring reliability.
3.1.1.4. **Fallbacks**: If WebSockets are not supported, Socket.IO can automatically fall back to other communication protocols, such as long polling.
3.1.1.5. **Namespaces**: Allows you to divide your application into different channels (called namespaces), enabling message isolation between them.
3.1.1.6. **Rooms**: A way of grouping clients together, which makes it easier to broadcast messages to certain groups of users.
3.1.1.7. **Event-based Communication**: Uses a simple event-driven architecture. Clients and servers emit and listen to events, making the interaction very intuitive.

---

#### 3.2. Which version have we used in the application?

#### **Socket.IO Version 2.0.12 Overview**

Socket.IO **version 2.0.12** is a **patch version** of **Socket.IO 2.x**, released after version 2.0, which brought significant changes to Socket.IO’s core architecture, including improved performance, support for newer browser versions, and API changes.

#### 3.2.1 **Key Features and Updates in Socket.IO 2.0.12**

While Socket.IO 2.x includes several important changes, version **2.0.12** (released in 2019) focused mainly on **bug fixes**, minor improvements, and ensuring compatibility with the latest platforms and environments.

---

#### Socket.IO Configuration in the Application

```java
import com.corundumstudio.socketio.Configuration;
import com.corundumstudio.socketio.SocketIOServer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class SocketIOConfig {

    @Bean
    public SocketIOServer socketIOServer() {
        Configuration config = new Configuration();
        config.setHostname("localhost");
        config.setPort(8080);
        config.setOrigin("*");

        return new SocketIOServer(config);
    }
}
```

#### 3.2.2. Explanation of Configuration Code in Detail

#### 3.2.2.1. **Package Imports** 
```java

import com.corundumstudio.socketio.Configuration; 

import com.corundumstudio.socketio.SocketIOServer; 

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
``` 

- **com.corundumstudio.socketio.Configuration**: This class is used to configure various settings for the **Socket.IO server** (such as the hostname, port, and other parameters). 
- **com.corundumstudio.socketio.SocketIOServer**: This is the main class that represents the **Socket.IO server**. It is responsible for starting the server, managing connections, and handling events. 
- **org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean**: The @Bean annotation from Spring is used to indicate that the method that follows should be treated as a **bean definition**. This allows Spring to manage the lifecycle of the SocketIOServer object and inject it into other parts of the application.

#### 3.2.2.2. **@Configuration Annotation** 
```java
@org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration 

public class SocketIOConfig { 
```
- **@Configuration**: This annotation is used to define a **Spring configuration class**, which contains bean definitions for the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. By marking the class with @Configuration, we tell Spring to treat it as a source of bean definitions, which are later injected where needed. 
- **public class SocketIOConfig**: This is the class where we configure the Socket.IO server. The class is named `SocketIOConfig` to reflect that it holds the configuration for Socket.IO.

#### 3.2.2.3. **@Bean Method for Socket.IO Server** 
```java
@Bean 

public SocketIOServer socketIOServer() { 

`    `Configuration config = new Configuration(); 

`    `config.setHostname("localhost"); 

`    `config.setPort(8080); 

`    `config.setOrigin("\*"); 

`    `return new SocketIOServer(config); 

} 
```
- **@Bean**: The @Bean annotation is used to declare a method as a **Spring Bean**. When Spring sees this annotation, it will call this method, create an object (in this case, a `SocketIOServer`), and manage it as a Spring-managed bean. This makes it possible to inject `SocketIOServer` into other components of the Spring application, enabling real-time communication features. 

- **public SocketIOServer socketIOServer()**: This is the method definition that returns a `SocketIOServer` bean. This method creates and configures a `SocketIOServer` instance, which is the core of your Socket.IO server.

 ---

#### 3.3. **Creating and Configuring the Socket.IO Server:** 

3.3.1. - **Configuration config = new Configuration();**: 
  - The `Configuration` class is used to hold the various configuration parameters for the Socket.IO server (such as hostname, port, and origins).
  
3.3.2. - **config.setHostname("localhost");**: 
  - This sets the **hostname** to "localhost". This means the server will only be accessible on the local machine (localhost). If you wanted the server to be accessible externally, you would need to set this to your machine's IP address or a domain name (like "example.com").
  
3.3.3. - **config.setPort(8080);**: 
  - This sets the **port** number for the Socket.IO server to listen on. In this case, the server will listen on port 8080. This is the same port number often used by web servers for development, so it will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a browser (or through WebSocket connections).

3.3.4. - **config.setOrigin("\*");**: 
  - This sets the **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** settings for the server. `setOrigin("*")` allows connections from any origin. This is useful in development environments or when your server needs to accept requests from multiple domains. In a production environment, you may want to restrict the allowed origins for security purposes (e.g., `config.setOrigin("https://example.com");`).

3.3.4. - **return new SocketIOServer(config);**: 
  - Finally, a **new SocketIOServer** instance is created with the configured `Configuration` object and returned from the method. This instance is now managed by the Spring context as a bean and can be used to listen for connections, emit events, and broadcast messages.

---

#### 3.4. **Why is This Code Used?**

This configuration is used to **initialize a Socket.IO server** within a Spring Boot application. The server is then capable of handling **real-time communication** with clients (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps). Socket.IO is used for applications that need low-latency, bidirectional communication, such as:

- **Chat applications** 
- **Real-time notifications** 
- **Collaborative tools**
- **Live updates** (sports scores, stock prices, etc.)
- **Multiplayer games** 

The `SocketIOServer` will listen for connections on the specified port (8080), handle events like user connections and disconnections, and can send/receive messages in real time.

---

#### 3.5 **How This Fits into the Spring Boot Application:** 

3.5.1. **Spring Boot Integration:**
   - Spring Boot applications typically use `@Configuration` classes to define and configure beans. In this case, we define a `SocketIOServer` bean, which is then available for injection into other components of the application.

3.5.2. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - With this configuration, the Socket.IO server is set up to handle real-time communication for clients that connect to the Spring Boot backend. The clients could be web clients (using **JavaScript Socket.IO client**), mobile apps, or even desktop applications.

3.5.3. **Dependency Injection:**
   - Spring will manage the lifecycle of the `SocketIOServer` bean. This means you can inject this `SocketIOServer` into other Spring beans to interact with the Socket.IO server and manage connections.

---

#### 3.6 **Potential Use Case**

In a typical scenario, after configuring the `SocketIOServer`:

- You might define a **Socket.IO event listener** that listens for custom events (e.g., messages, user actions).
- You could use **broadcasting** to send real-time updates to multiple connected clients.
- The **Socket.IO server** could emit events back to the client or listen for client messages and trigger actions on the backend.

For example, you might have a **message event** where a client sends a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to all other connected clients. 

java 

Copy: 
```java
socketIOServer.addEventListener("message", String.class, (client, data, ackSender) -> { 

socketIOServer.getBroadcastOperations().sendEvent("newMessage", data); 

}); 
```
3.6.1. **Key Concepts:** 

- **Spring Boot Configuration**: Using `@Configuration` and `@Bean` to configure and manage `SocketIOServer` as a Spring bean.
- **Socket.IO Server**: A server that manages real-time communication using WebSockets or other protocols and is integrated into a Spring Boot application.
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Using Socket.IO to send and receive events, enabling real-time bidirectional communication between server and client.

---

#### 3.7 **Conclusion**:

This configuration class sets up a **Socket.IO server** that listens for WebSocket connections on a Spring Boot backend. By doing so, it enables your application to support **real-time communication** with clients. Using **Spring's dependency injection** and **Socket.IO's real-time capabilities**, your app can handle events, broadcast updates, and communicate with clients instantly.

---

#### 3.8 **Set up of Socket.IO using ReactJS (with Vite) on the Front End and Spring Boot on the Back End for Real-Time Communication**

#### **Overview**

- **Backend**: We'll use **Spring Boot** with **Socket.IO** for handling real-time connections.
- **Frontend**: We'll use **ReactJS** (created using **Vite**) and the **Socket.IO client** to connect to the Spring Boot server for real-time communication.

#### 3.8.1 **Backend: Spring Boot + Socket.IO**

#### 3.8.1.1 **Step 1: Set up Spring Boot with Socket.IO** 

1. **Create a Spring Boot project** using Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE. 
   - Dependencies: 
     - **Spring Web** (for basic REST APIs)
     - **Socket.IO** (via the `netty-socketio` library)

2. **Add dependencies to `pom.xml`:** 

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter Web -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Socket.IO (Netty version) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.corundumstudio.socketio</groupId>
        <artifactId>netty-socketio</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version> <!-- Make sure to use the correct version -->
    </dependency>

    <!-- Spring Boot Starter for JPA (Optional, if using databases) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
#### **Step 3: Create `SocketIOConfig.java` to Configure the Socket.IO Server**

#### `SocketIOConfig.java`

```java
import com.corundumstudio.socketio.Configuration;
import com.corundumstudio.socketio.SocketIOServer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class SocketIOConfig {

    @Bean
    public SocketIOServer socketIOServer() {
        // Create the configuration object for Socket.IO server
        Configuration config = new Configuration();

        // Set the hostname to localhost and port to 8080
        config.setHostname("localhost");
        config.setPort(8080); // Socket.IO server listens on port 8080

        // Set origin to '*' to allow all origins (adjust for production)
        config.setOrigin("*");

        // Initialize the Socket.IO server with the configuration
        SocketIOServer server = new SocketIOServer(config);

        // Listen to 'chat' events from the client
        server.addEventListener("chat", String.class, (client, data, ackSender) -> {
            System.out.println("Message received from client: " + data);

            // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
            server.getBroadcastOperations().sendEvent("chat", data);
        });

        // Start the Socket.IO server
        server.start();

        // Return the SocketIOServer bean to be managed by Spring
        return server;
    }
}
```
- In this configuration, we are setting up a **Socket.IO server** that listens for **"chat"** events and sends the received data to all connected clients (broadcasting).

---

#### **Step 4: Create `SocketController.java` (Optional)** to Expose an HTTP Endpoint

If you need to expose additional HTTP endpoints along with the Socket.IO server, you can create a simple controller. Below is an optional example of a Spring Boot controller.

#### `SocketController.java`

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class SocketController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```
#### **Step 5: Run the Spring Boot Application** This starts a **Socket.IO server** on localhost:8080. 

#### 3.8.2 **Frontend: ReactJS + Vite + Socket.IO Client**

#### 3.8.2.1 **Step 2: Set up React with Vite and Socket.IO Client**

1. **Create a new React app** using **Vite**:

   Run the following command to create a new React app with the Vite template:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
   cd my-app
   ```

---

#### **Step 2: Install the required dependencies**

To enable real-time communication between the React frontend and the Socket.IO server, you need to install the **Socket.IO client**.

Run the following command to install it:

```bash
npm install socket.io-client
```

---

#### **Step 3: Create the ChatApp.js Component**

In this step, you will create a **ChatApp.js** component that allows the user to send and receive messages using **Socket.IO**.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

// Connect to the Spring Boot Socket.IO server
const socket = io("http://localhost:8080");

function ChatApp() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  // Listen for incoming messages from the server
  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on("chat", (data) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, data]);
    });

    // Clean up the socket connection when the component is unmounted
    return () => {
      socket.off("chat");
    };
  }, []);

  // Handle sending messages to the server
  const sendMessage = () => {
    if (message.trim() !== "") {
      socket.emit("chat", message); // Emit "chat" event to the server
      setMessage(""); // Clear the input field
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Socket.IO Chat</h2>
      <div>
        <div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          {messages.map((msg, index) => (
            <div key={index}>{msg}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={message}
          onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type a message"
        />
        <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChatApp;
```

---

#### **Understanding Key Parts of the Code:**

1. **Connecting to the Socket.IO Server**:
   - `socket = io("http://localhost:8080")`: 
     - This establishes a WebSocket connection to the **Socket.IO server** running on `localhost:8080`, which is handled by the Spring Boot backend. 
     - The `io()` function from the `socket.io-client` library is used to initiate this connection.

2. **Handling Incoming Messages**:
   - `socket.on("chat", (data) => {...})`: 
     - Listens for the `"chat"` event emitted by the server.
     - When a message is received, it adds the message to the `messages` state array, which updates the UI to display the new message.

3. **Sending Messages**:
   - `socket.emit("chat", message)`:
     - This sends the `"chat"` event to the Socket.IO server along with the message content (`message`).
     - The server receives the event and can broadcast it to all connected clients, enabling real-time communication between them.

---

#### **Summary:**

- The **Socket.IO client** in the React app connects to the backend, listens for incoming messages, and sends messages to the server using the `emit` and `on` methods.
- This allows for **bidirectional, real-time communication** between the frontend (ReactJS) and the backend (Spring Boot with Socket.IO).

---

---

#### 3.8.3 **Step 3: Update `App.js` to Use `ChatApp` Component**

In this step, you'll import the `ChatApp` component into the `App.js` file and render it inside the main application.

#### **Code:**
```jsx
import React from "react"; 
import ChatApp from "./ChatApp"; // Import the ChatApp component

function App() { 
  return ( 
    <div className="App">
      <ChatApp />  {/* Render the ChatApp component */}
    </div> 
  ); 
}

export default App;
```

---

#### 3.8.4 **Step 4: Run the React + Vite Application**

#### **1. Start the React Development Server**:

To run the React application, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

#### 3.9 **How Socket.IO Works Here:**

#### 3.9.1. Backend (Spring Boot):**
1. When a client sends a chat event (through `socket.emit("chat", message)`), the Spring Boot backend receives it via `server.addEventListener("chat", ...)`.
2. The backend then broadcasts the message to all connected clients using `server.getBroadcastOperations().sendEvent("chat", data)`.

#### 3.9.2. Frontend (React + Vite):**
1. The React app listens for the `chat` event through `socket.on("chat", ...)`, and when the event is received, it updates the UI with the new message.
2. When a user sends a message, the React app emits a `chat` event to the Spring Boot server, which broadcasts it back to all connected clients.

---

#### 3.10 **Summary of Communication Flow:**

3.10.1. **User Interaction**: 
   - The user types a message in the React app and clicks the "Send" button.
   
3.10.2. **Frontend**: 
   - The React app emits a `chat` event to the Spring Boot backend.
   
3.10.3. **Backend**: 
   - The Spring Boot server receives the `chat` event, processes it, and broadcasts it to all connected clients.
   
3.10.4. **Frontend**: 
   - All connected React clients receive the `chat` event and update their UI with the new message.

---

#### 3.11 **Testing It:**

3.11.1. Open **two browser windows** at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3.11.2. Send a message in one window, and you should see the message appear in real-time in the other window.
3.11.3. The message is sent from the client to the server, and the server broadcasts it to all connected clients.

---

#### **Conclusion**

This setup demonstrates how to use **Socket.IO** for real-time communication between a **React frontend** and a **Spring Boot backend**. By combining the power of **Socket.IO** for event-driven, bi-directional communication with **Spring Boot** and **ReactJS**, you can easily build interactive real-time web applications.

---

### 4. Configuration of application.properties

#### 3.1. what is application.properties?
In Spring Boot, `application.properties` is a configuration file that allows you to set various properties to customize the behavior of the application. It's the default file used to store configuration settings for different components of a Spring Boot application, such as the server, database, logging, security, and more.

It can be used to configure properties related to:

- **Database connections**
- **Server settings** (e.g., port number, context path)
- **Logging configuration**
- **JPA** (Java Persistence API) settings
- **Security properties**
- **File upload limits**
- **Spring-specific configuration properties** (such as cache, session management, etc.)

You can use `application.properties` to configure your Spring Boot application in a **centralized** and **externalized** way, so the application can be easily customized without having to modify the source code.

---

##How has the application.properties file been configured in the application?
```java
spring.application.name=157-project1
server.port=3000
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:MySql://localhost:3306/157task
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=8446394639
#spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=10MB
```

#### Explanation of `application.properties` Configuration

This configuration file is typically found in the `application.properties` file in a Spring Boot project. It's used to configure various properties for the Spring Boot application, such as server settings, data source (database) configurations, and file upload settings. Let's go through each line of this file to explain its significance.

#### 1. `spring.application.name=157-project1`
- **Purpose**: This sets the name of the Spring Boot application. It's useful for identifying the application, especially when using tools like Spring Boot Admin or logging.
- **Why it's necessary**: It helps give a human-readable name to the application, which is particularly useful when you have multiple services running.

#### 2. `server.port=3000`
- **Purpose**: This sets the port on which the embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat) will run. By default, Spring Boot runs on port 8080, but in this case, it's explicitly set to run on port 3000.
- **Why it's necessary**: This is needed if you want to change the default port Spring Boot uses to a custom port (in this case, port 3000). You might need to change it to avoid port conflicts or for specific requirements in your environment.

#### 3. `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:MySql://localhost:3306/157task`
- **Purpose**: This property configures the URL of the database Spring Boot will connect to. The `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/157task` URL specifies that the application should use MySQL as the database and connect to it via localhost (the local machine) on port 3306 (default MySQL port). The database name is `157task`.
- **Why it's necessary**: This is needed to tell Spring Boot which database to connect to. Without this, the application won’t know where to find the database, and database operations would fail.

#### 4. `spring.datasource.username=root`
- **Purpose**: This specifies the username that Spring Boot will use to authenticate to the database. In this case, it is set to `root`, which is a default MySQL user.
- **Why it's necessary**: The username is required to connect to the database. It tells the application what credentials to use for accessing the database.

#### 5. `spring.datasource.password=8446394639`
- **Purpose**: This specifies the password corresponding to the username (`root` in this case). It's used for authenticating the connection to the MySQL database.
- **Why it's necessary**: The password is essential for authenticating the user and establishing a secure connection to the database.

#### 6. `#spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`
- **Purpose**: This is a commented-out line (due to the `#` symbol) that typically specifies the driver class for the MySQL database. The driver class is necessary for connecting Java to MySQL. However, Spring Boot automatically detects the correct driver when using the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency, so you generally don’t need to specify this unless there are specific issues.
- **Why it's necessary**: If you're using a database like MySQL, you would normally specify the driver class (`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`), but in most cases, Spring Boot can automatically detect it when the appropriate dependency (`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`) is added. The commented-out line is simply a fallback or an optional setting.

#### 7. `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`
- **Purpose**: This property tells Hibernate (the JPA implementation) how to handle database schema generation. The value `update` means that Hibernate will automatically update the database schema to match the entity classes each time the application is run.
    - Possible values:
        - `none`: No schema generation is performed.
        - `update`: Updates the schema by adding new tables/columns or modifying existing ones, but doesn't delete any data.
        - `create`: Drops and recreates the schema on each startup.
        - `create-drop`: Same as `create`, but it also drops the schema when the session factory is closed (useful for testing).
- **Why it's necessary**: This is important for automatic schema management. Setting it to `update` ensures that if your entity classes change, the database schema will automatically adjust accordingly.

#### 8. `spring.jpa.show-sql=true`
- **Purpose**: This property enables SQL logging. When set to `true`, it will log the SQL statements executed by Hibernate (or any JPA provider).
- **Why it's necessary**: It’s useful for debugging, as you can see the exact SQL queries that Hibernate is executing on the database. This helps when you want to verify the SQL that your entities are producing, especially during development.

#### 9. `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect`
- **Purpose**: This property defines the Hibernate dialect to use. The dialect is a Hibernate configuration setting that ensures the correct SQL is generated for the underlying database. In this case, `MySQL8Dialect` tells Hibernate to generate SQL optimized for MySQL 8.
- **Why it's necessary**: It's crucial to set the correct dialect so that Hibernate generates the right SQL syntax for your MySQL database. Without the proper dialect, Hibernate may produce SQL that’s not compatible with your database, leading to errors.

#### 10. `spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true`
- **Purpose**: This property enables support for multipart file uploads in the application.
- **Why it's necessary**: It’s needed if your application will handle file uploads. For example, if you have a feature that allows users to upload images or documents, this property enables Spring Boot to handle those files.

#### 11. `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB`
- **Purpose**: This specifies the maximum allowed file size for uploads. In this case, it’s set to `10MB`.
- **Why it's necessary**: It defines a file size limit for uploads. This is useful to prevent users from uploading excessively large files that could impact server performance or stability. Without this, there would be no limit on the file sizes, which could be problematic.

#### 12. `spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=10MB`
- **Purpose**: This property sets the maximum size for an entire HTTP request, including the uploaded file(s). It’s also set to `10MB` in this case.
- **Why it's necessary**: It’s essential to have a limit on the total size of the request to avoid issues when dealing with multiple or very large files. Without this, users could upload very large files, potentially affecting the server’s memory and performance.

---

### Development Workflow: Full-Stack

#### Front-End Interaction:

- The user interacts with the front-end of the application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The front-end, powered by ReactJS library, renders the user interface and handles user inputs.
- When the user performs an action (e.g., clicking a button, submitting a form), the front-end sends a request to the API.

#### API Processing:

- The API receives the request from the front-end.
- It processes the request, which may involve:
  - Validating the input data
  - Fetching data from the database
  - Performing business logic operations
  - Creating or updating data in the database

#### Back-End Processing:

- The API interacts with the back-end, which is built using Java and the Spring Boot framework.
- The back-end handles the API request, executes the necessary logic, and communicates with the database using the JDBC connector.

#### Database Interaction:

- The back-end interacts with the MySQL database through the JDBC connector.
- It retrieves or stores data as per the API request.

#### API Response:

- Once the back-end processes the request and interacts with the database, it sends a response back to the API.

#### Front-End Update:

- The API receives the response from the back-end.
- It sends the response to the front-end.
- The front-end updates the user interface based on the received data, providing feedback to the user.

#### DevOps:

- After development, the application is deployed using DevOps practices.
- Nginx server is used to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate backend services.
- Hostinger provides the infrastructure for hosting the application and managing the database.

#### Workflow Summary:

1. User interaction on the front-end.
2. Communication between the front-end, API, and back-end.
3. Database interaction for data storage and retrieval.
4. Deployment and maintenance using DevOps tools.

This workflow ensures that user actions are processed efficiently, data is managed securely, and the application is available to users.

#### **Employee Management API Explanation:**


This API defines endpoints for managing employee data in a system. It supports operations like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving employee details.

#### 1. POST (Add Employee)
**Purpose:** To add a new employee to the system.  
**Request:**  
It makes a POST request to a URL that includes the `employeeId` and `userType` (e.g., role of the employee, like "manager", "staff", etc.). These are dynamic values, meaning they are replaced by actual data when the request is made.  
**Body:**  
The body of the request contains `formDataToSend`, which is the data of the new employee (e.g., name, email, department, etc.).  
**Example URL:**  
`/add-employee/123/manager`  
(Where `123` is the `employeeId` and `manager` is the `userType`).  
**Outcome:**  
The server processes this data and adds the new employee to the system.

#### 2. PUT (Update Employee)
**Purpose:** To update an existing employee's details.  
**Request:**  
It makes a PUT request to a URL that includes the `employeeId` to specify which employee to update.  
**Body:**  
The request body contains `formDataToSend`, which includes the updated employee details (e.g., updated name, email, etc.).  
**Example URL:**  
`/update-employee/123`  
(Where `123` is the `employeeId` of the employee to be updated).  
**Outcome:**  
The server updates the employee's data with the new information provided in the request body.

#### 3. DELETE (Delete Employee)
**Purpose:** To delete an existing employee from the system.  
**Request:**  
It makes a DELETE request to a URL that includes the `employeeId` of the employee to be deleted.  
**Example URL:**  
`/delete-employee/123`  
(Where `123` is the `employeeId` of the employee to be deleted).  
**Outcome:**  
The server removes the employee's data from the system.

#### 4. GET (Get Employee)
**Purpose:** To retrieve the details of a specific employee.  
**Request:**  
It makes a GET request to a URL that includes the `employeeId` of the employee whose details are to be fetched.  

```

#### Fetch Employee Team Details with `useEffect`

This code demonstrates how to use the `useEffect` hook in React to fetch employee team details from a backend API whenever certain state variables (`currentPage` or `pageSize`) change.

#### Code Example

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async (page, size) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(
        `${API_BASE_URL}/fetch-Team-details/${employeeId}/${userType}?page=${page}&size=${size}`
      );
      setEmployeeData(response.data.content);
      setLoading(false);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchData(currentPage, pageSize);
}, [currentPage, pageSize]);

```

### Understanding the `useEffect` Hook in React

The following code demonstrates the use of the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects in a React component, specifically fetching data from an API.

#### Code Example

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // fetchData function and API call inside the useEffect
}, [currentPage, pageSize]);
```



#### 1. **Purpose of `useEffect`**
- `useEffect` allows you to run side effects in your components.
- In this example, the side effect is **fetching data from an API**.

#### 2. **Arguments of `useEffect`**
The `useEffect` hook takes **two arguments**:
1. **Callback Function**:
   - Contains the logic for the side effect. 
   - For example, the API fetching logic would go inside this callback.
2. **Dependency Array**:
   - Specifies when the effect should re-run.
   - In this case, the dependency array is `[currentPage, pageSize]`.
   - **Effect Behavior**: 
     - The effect will run whenever either `currentPage` or `pageSize` changes.

#### 3. **When Does `useEffect` Run?**
- **Initial Render**: The `useEffect` runs after the first render.
- **Dependency Changes**: It re-runs whenever a value in the dependency array changes.
- **No Dependencies**: If the array is empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once, after the component mounts.

### 5. Back-End Code flow

#### 3.1. Add Employee

#### **Main class code:**
```java
package _7.project1;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

}
```
#### **Explantion of code:**
#### Spring Boot Application: `Application.java`

This is the main entry point of a Spring Boot application. Let's break it down:

#### 1. **`@SpringBootApplication` Annotation:**
   - **`@SpringBootApplication`** is a convenience annotation that combines the following:
     - **`@EnableAutoConfiguration`**: Tells Spring Boot to automatically configure your application based on the dependencies in the classpath.
     - **`@ComponentScan`**: Enables component scanning, so Spring can detect and register your beans (such as controllers, services, repositories, etc.) in the application context.
     - **`@Configuration`**: Indicates that this class contains Spring configuration (i.e., bean definitions).
   
   This annotation is typically placed on the main class of a Spring Boot application, as it kick-starts the auto-configuration and sets up the application context.

#### 2. **`public class Application`:**
   - This is the main class of the application. It's typically named `Application` or something similar, and it serves as the entry point for running the Spring Boot application.

#### 3. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the main method that runs when the application starts.
   - **`String[] args`** allows command-line arguments to be passed when starting the application. These arguments are passed to `SpringApplication.run(...)`.
   
#### 4. **`SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args)`:**
   - **`SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args)`** is a method that launches the Spring Boot application.
     - **`Application.class`**: Refers to the class that contains the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation. It's the starting point of the Spring context.
     - **`args`**: These are the command-line arguments passed to the application.

   This method will initialize the Spring context and all the beans defined in the application, start the embedded web server (like Tomcat, Jetty, etc.), and handle HTTP requests (if your application is a web application). After calling this, the application starts running.

#### In Summary:
- **`@SpringBootApplication`** configures the Spring Boot application.
- **`main()` method** is the entry point for the Java application.
- **`SpringApplication.run()`** starts the Spring Boot application and the embedded web server.

This structure is standard for a Spring Boot application, and it's often referred to as the **"Spring Boot Bootstrap"** because it initializes the Spring context and enables all auto-configured components.

#### **Explanation of code:**
#### Employee Entity Class (JPA Model)

This Java class represents an **Employee** entity in a database using **JPA (Java Persistence API)**. It is annotated with **Jakarta Persistence** annotations and **Lombok** annotations to simplify the code.

#### 1. Annotations:
- **`@Entity`**: Marks the class as a JPA entity, indicating that it will map to a table in the database.
- **`@Table(name = "employee", uniqueConstraints = {@UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "user_name")})`**: Specifies the name of the table (`employee`) and enforces a unique constraint on the `user_name` column.
- **`@Id`**: Denotes that the `employee_Id` field is the primary key of the entity.
- **`@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "employee_seq_generator")`**: Specifies how the `employee_Id` value will be generated, using a sequence generator defined by `@SequenceGenerator`.
- **`@SequenceGenerator(name = "employee_seq_generator", sequenceName = "employee_seq", allocationSize = 1)`**: Defines the sequence generator used to generate primary key values.
- **`@Column`**: Maps the class fields to corresponding columns in the database table. It allows specifying additional constraints like `nullable`, `unique`, etc.
- **`@Lob`**: Indicates that the field should be stored as a large object (binary data like files or large text). This is used for `profile_image`, `document`, and `resume_file`.

#### 2. Fields (Attributes):
The class has numerous fields, each representing a piece of information about an employee. The fields have various data types like `String`, `long`, `double`, and `byte[]` (for storing large binary objects). Here’s an overview of what each field represents:

- **Basic Info**: `employee_Id`, `employeeName`, `userName`, `dateOfJoining`, `dateOfBirth`, `gender`, `maritalStatus`, etc.
- **Contact Info**: `officialMail`, `employeeEmail`, `officialContactNumber`, `companyMobileNumber`, `whatsAppNumber`, etc.
- **Job Details**: `designation`, `department`, `lastCompany`, `workLocation`, `jobRole`, `offeredSalary`, etc.
- **Personal Info**: `bloodGroup`, `aadhaarNo`, `panNo`, `employeeAddress`, etc.
- **Emergency Info**: `emergencyContactNumber`, `emergencyPersonRelation`, etc.
- **Miscellaneous**: `perks`, `employeeStatus`, `inductionYesOrNo`, `performanceIndicator`, etc.
- **Social Media/Links**: `linkedInURl`, `faceBookURL`, `twitterURl`.
- **Documents**: `profileImage`, `document`, `resumeFile` (stored as large binary objects using `@Lob`).

#### 3. Lombok Annotations:
- **`@NoArgsConstructor`**: Automatically generates a no-argument constructor for the class. This is required by JPA for creating instances.
- **`@AllArgsConstructor`**: Generates a constructor with parameters for all fields in the class. This allows creating objects with all properties at once.

#### 4. Other Attributes:
- **Profile Image/Document/Resume**: These are stored as binary data (`byte[]`), and **`@Lob`** is used to indicate that they are large objects (e.g., images, PDFs).
- **Login and Authority**: Fields like `loginStatus` and `editDeleteAuthority` control permissions and the user’s login status.
- **Miscellaneous Fields**: Fields like `inductionComment`, `performanceIndicator`, and `teamLeaderMsg` are likely used to store feedback or comments related to the employee’s performance or other work-related aspects.

#### 5. Methods:
The class includes **getters and setters** for all fields. These methods are generated manually, but **Lombok** annotations (`@NoArgsConstructor` and `@AllArgsConstructor`) help reduce boilerplate code for constructors.

#### Summary of What's Happening:
- The **Employee** class represents an entity in a relational database, capturing various details about an employee (personal, contact, job-related, etc.).
- **JPA annotations** are used to map the class to a table and define column mappings, constraints (like primary key generation and unique constraints).
- **Lombok annotations** reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating constructors.
- The class handles **binary data** (like profile images and documents) using `@Lob`, indicating these fields store large binary objects.
- The class facilitates interaction with a database by storing employee details, possibly using **EntityManager** or **JpaRepository** for persistence operations.

#### **Repository code:**
```java
package _7.project1.Repository;

import _7.project1.Entity.Employee;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import java.util.Optional;

@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
    Optional<Employee> findByUserName(String username);
    Optional<Employee> findById(Long id);
}
```

}

```

#### **Explanation of code:**
#### EmployeeService Class

This code defines the `EmployeeService` class, which is part of a Spring Boot application. The purpose of this service is to manage `Employee` entities in the system. It handles adding and updating employee information and interacts with two repositories: `EmployeeRepository` (for managing employee data) and `CallingTrackerRepository` (although the latter is not used in this code).

#### 1. Annotations

#### `@Service`
- **Purpose**: This annotation marks the class as a service component in Spring's service layer.
- **Functionality**: By annotating the `EmployeeService` class with `@Service`, Spring will automatically register it as a Spring Bean in the application context, meaning it will be automatically managed by Spring's Dependency Injection (DI) container.

#### `@Autowired`
- **Purpose**: The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies.
- **Functionality**: In this case, Spring will automatically provide instances of the `EmployeeRepository` and `CallingTrackerRepository` beans into the `EmployeeService` class. These repositories will be used to interact with the database.

#### 2. Instance Variables

#### `private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository`
- **Purpose**: This is the repository interface for `Employee` entities. `EmployeeRepository` extends `JpaRepository`, so it provides basic CRUD operations such as `save()`, `findById()`, and `findByUserName()` out of the box, without the need to write custom SQL queries.

#### `private CallingTrackerRepository callingTrackerRepository`
- **Purpose**: This is another repository that is injected, but it is not used in the current code. It might be useful for future features that track calls or actions related to employees (e.g., tracking communication or interactions).

#### 3. The `addEmployee` Method

This is the primary method in the service. It either updates an existing employee or adds a new one based on whether an employee with the given username already exists.

#### Method Signature:
```java
public Employee addEmployee(Employee employee)

```
#### Purpose:
This method takes an Employee object as input and returns the saved Employee object. It handles both creating new employees and updating existing ones.

#### Logic:
#### Step 1. **Check if the Employee Already Exists:**
```java
Optional<Employee> existingEmployee = employeeRepository.findByUserName(employee.getUserName());

```
This line checks if an employee with the same `userName` already exists in the database by calling the `findByUserName` method in the `EmployeeRepository`. This method returns an `Optional<Employee>`, which may contain an `Employee` if one is found, or be empty if no employee with the provided username exists.

#### Step 2: If Employee Exists, Update Their Details
```java
if (existingEmployee.isPresent()) {
    Employee updatedEmployee = existingEmployee.get();
    // Set all employee fields from the incoming employee object
    updatedEmployee.setEmployeeName(employee.getEmployeeName());
    updatedEmployee.setUserName(employee.getUserName());
    // ... (set all other fields)
    return employeeRepository.save(updatedEmployee);
}

```
If an employee with the given username exists, we retrieve the existing employee (`existingEmployee.get()`).  
Then, we update each field of the existing employee using the values from the `employee` object passed to the method. This allows us to modify specific details (like name, email, designation, etc.) without replacing the entire record.  
After updating all fields, the method saves the updated employee back into the database using `employeeRepository.save(updatedEmployee)`. This persists the changes to the database.

#### Step 3: If Employee Does Not Exist, Save as a New Employee
```java
else {
    return employeeRepository.save(employee);
}

```
If no existing employee is found (i.e., the `existingEmployee` is empty), this block of code is executed. In this case, the method directly saves the new `Employee` object to the database using `employeeRepository.save(employee)`.

The `save()` method is provided by `JpaRepository` and performs the persistence operation, either inserting a new record or updating an existing one depending on the state of the `Employee` entity.

#### step 4: Get Employee By ID
```java
public Optional<Employee> getEmployeeById(Long empId) {
    return employeeRepository.findById(empId);
}
```
This method allows you to retrieve an employee by their employee ID (empId).
employeeRepository.findById(empId) returns an Optional<Employee>, which will contain the employee data if found, or be empty if no employee exists with that ID.

#### step 5:Get All Employees
```java
public Iterable<Employee> getAllEmployees() {
    return employeeRepository.findAll();
}

```
This method retrieves all the employees in the database.
employeeRepository.findAll() returns an Iterable of Employee objects, representing all the records in the Employee table.

#### step 6: Delete Employee By ID
```java
public void deleteEmployee(Long empId) {
    employeeRepository.deleteById(empId);
}

```
This method deletes an employee by their ID.
employeeRepository.deleteById(empId) deletes the employee record with the given empId from the database.

#### step 7: The getEmployeeByUserName Method:
```java
public Optional<Employee> getEmployeeByUserName(String username)

```   
#### Purpose:
This method retrieves an `Employee` from the database by their username.  
It uses the `findByUserName` method in the `EmployeeRepository` to fetch the employee. The return type is an `Optional<Employee>`, which is a safe way of handling potential null values. If no employee with the provided username exists, it returns `Optional.empty()`.

#### **Key Points:**

#### 1. **Repository Layer**:  
The `EmployeeRepository` is a Spring Data JPA repository that provides methods like `findByUserName()` and `save()`. These methods allow the `EmployeeService` to interact with the database without the need to write custom SQL queries. The repository handles data access and provides an abstraction over the underlying database operations.

#### 2. **Updating an Employee**:  
The `addEmployee` method offers a detailed approach to updating an employee’s record. Instead of replacing the entire employee entity, it updates individual fields of the existing employee. This approach provides more control, as it allows you to update specific fields while leaving other fields unchanged. It prevents overwriting unnecessary data and ensures only relevant changes are made.

#### 3. **Use of Optional**:  
The `Optional<Employee>` return type from methods like `findByUserName` is a good practice because it helps avoid potential `NullPointerExceptions`. By using `Optional`, the code forces the caller to explicitly handle the case where the employee might not exist. For example, the caller must check if the `Optional` contains a value using methods like `isPresent()` before accessing the actual employee data.

#### 4. **The Role of CallingTrackerRepository**:  
Although `CallingTrackerRepository` is injected into the `EmployeeService`, it is not used within the current method. This repository might serve another purpose in the application, such as tracking employee-related calls, actions, or interactions elsewhere in the codebase. This is a placeholder for potential future use or another area of the application that deals with employee call tracking.

#### 5. **Spring's Dependency Injection**:  
The `@Autowired` annotations are used to indicate that Spring will automatically inject dependencies into the `EmployeeService` class. In this case, Spring manages the lifecycle of `EmployeeRepository` and `CallingTrackerRepository`. The framework automatically wires these repositories into the service class, ensuring that the service can use them to interact with the database without manual setup.

#### 6. **Get Employee by ID**:  
The `getEmployeeById` method retrieves an employee using their unique **employee ID**. It calls `employeeRepository.findById(empId)`, which returns an `Optional<Employee>`. The use of `Optional` ensures that the method handles the possibility of the employee not being found in the database, preventing null pointer exceptions. The caller must check if the `Optional` contains an employee before attempting to access the data.

#### 7. **Get All Employees**:  
The `getAllEmployees` method fetches all employees from the database. It uses `employeeRepository.findAll()`, which returns all employee records stored in the database as an iterable collection. This method provides a way to access every employee in the system.

#### 8. **Delete Employee by ID**:  
The `deleteEmployee` method allows the deletion of an employee based on their unique **employee ID**. It calls `employeeRepository.deleteById(empId)` to remove the corresponding record from the database. This operation ensures that the employee's data is permanently removed from the system.


#### Summary:

- The `EmployeeService` class is a Spring service component that handles the logic for adding or updating employee records.
- The `addEmployee` method checks whether an employee with a specific username exists and either updates the existing record or creates a new one.
- The getEmployeeByUserName method allows fetching an employee by their username.
- The getEmployeeById method fetches an employee by their ID.
- The getAllEmployees method retrieves all employees stored in the database.
- The deleteEmployee method deletes an employee record by their ID.
- The `getEmployeeByUserName` method allows fetching an employee by their username.
- This class acts as an intermediary between the controller layer (which handles HTTP requests) and the repository layer (which interacts with the database).

        }
    }
    }
}

```

#### **Explanation of code:**
#### This code defines a Spring Boot `EmployeeController` class that handles HTTP requests related to employee and calling tracker data. It serves as an interface between the frontend (or client) and the service layer, allowing clients to add employees and calling tracker data.

#### Let’s break down the code in detail:

#### Code Breakdown

#### 1. Annotations

- **@RestController**
  - **Purpose**:  
    The `@RestController` annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller`. It is used in Spring MVC to create RESTful web services. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, meaning every method in this controller will return the response body directly, typically in JSON or XML format.
  - **Functionality**:  
    This class is a controller in a REST API, and the return values of methods will automatically be converted to HTTP responses (e.g., JSON).
  
- **@RequestMapping("/api/employee")**
  - **Purpose**:  
    The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers. In this case, the base URL for all routes in this controller is `/api/employee`.
  - **Functionality**:  
    All endpoints in this controller will be prefixed with `/api/employee`.

- **@Autowired**
  - **Purpose**:  
    The `@Autowired` annotation is used for dependency injection in Spring. It automatically injects the necessary service beans into this controller.

- **@PostMapping**
  - **Purpose**:  
    The `@PostMapping` annotation is used to handle HTTP POST requests. It is shorthand for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`.
  - **Functionality**:  
    In this case, the controller has two POST methods for adding employees and calling tracker data.

- **@RequestBody**
  - **Purpose**:  
    The `@RequestBody` annotation binds the HTTP request body to a method parameter. In this code, it is used to deserialize the incoming JSON payload into a Java object (`Employee` or `CallingTrackerLineUpDto`).

- **@PathVariable**
  - **Purpose**:  
    The `@PathVariable` annotation is used to bind the value of a URI template variable to a method parameter. In this case, the employee ID is extracted from the URL and passed to the method.

#### 2. Instance Variables

- **private EmployeeService employeeService**
  - **Purpose**:  
    This is the service layer that handles business logic for employee-related operations (e.g., adding and updating employees). It is injected into the controller using `@Autowired`.

- **private CallingTrackerService callingTrackerService**
  - **Purpose**:  
    This is another service layer that handles business logic related to calling tracker operations. It is also injected into the controller using `@Autowired`.

#### 3. Methods

- **addEmployee Method**
```java
@PostMapping("/add")
public ResponseEntity<Employee> addEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
    try {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(employeeService.addEmployee(employee), HttpStatus.OK);
    } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(null, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}

```
#### Purpose:
This method is responsible for adding a new employee to the system. It is mapped to the URL `/api/employee/add`.

#### Request:
The method expects an `Employee` object in the HTTP request body (annotated with `@RequestBody`).

#### Logic:
- The employee data is passed to the `addEmployee` method of the `EmployeeService` class.
- If the employee is successfully added, the method returns a `ResponseEntity` with a `HttpStatus.OK` (200) status and the employee data.
- If any error occurs (e.g., a `RuntimeException`), it returns a `ResponseEntity` with a `HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST` (400) status.

#### Return:
A `ResponseEntity<Employee>` is returned, containing the employee data and an HTTP status code indicating whether the operation was successful.

#### **`@GetMapping("/{empId}")` Method:** 
```java
@GetMapping("/{empId}")
public Optional<Employee> getEmployee(@PathVariable Long empId) {
    return employeeService.getEmployeeById(empId);
}
```
Certainly! Here's the explanation in Markdown format:

---

#### **Purpose:**
This endpoint is designed to retrieve an employee’s details based on their unique employee ID.

#### **@GetMapping("/{empId}")**:
- This annotation maps HTTP GET requests to the method.
- The `{empId}` part of the path is a path variable that will be substituted with the actual employee ID passed in the request URL.

#### **@PathVariable Long empId**:
- The `empId` parameter gets the value of the employee ID from the URL.

#### **Method**:
- It calls the `employeeService.getEmployeeById(empId)` method to fetch the employee data from the database using the service layer.

#### **Return Type**:
- The method returns an `Optional<Employee>`. This means that if an employee with the provided ID exists, the `Optional` will contain the employee object; if not, the `Optional` will be empty.

#### **(@GetMapping) Method:**
```java
@GetMapping
public Iterable<Employee> getAllEmployees() {
    return employeeService.getAllEmployees();
}

```
Certainly! Here's the explanation in Markdown format:

---

#### **Purpose:**
This endpoint is designed to retrieve a list of all employees from the database.

#### **@GetMapping:**
- The method is mapped to the HTTP GET request for the `/employees` path (i.e., it will be triggered by a GET request without any specific employee ID).

#### **Method:**
- It calls the `employeeService.getAllEmployees()` method, which fetches all employee records from the database.

#### **Return Type:**
- The method returns an `Iterable<Employee>`, which is a collection of all employee records.

####  **(@DeleteMapping("/{empId}")) Method:**
```java
@DeleteMapping("/{empId}")
public void deleteEmployee(@PathVariable Long empId) {
    employeeService.deleteEmployee(empId);
}

```
Certainly! Here's the explanation in Markdown format:

---

#### **Purpose:**
This endpoint is designed to delete an employee from the database using their employee ID.

#### **@DeleteMapping("/{empId}")**:
- The `@DeleteMapping` annotation maps the HTTP DELETE request to this method.
- The `{empId}` part of the path is a path variable that will be replaced with the actual employee ID passed in the request URL.

#### **@PathVariable Long empId**:
- The `empId` is extracted from the URL and passed into the method to identify the employee to be deleted.

#### **Method:**
- It calls the `employeeService.deleteEmployee(empId)` method to delete the employee record with the specified ID from the database.

#### **Return Type:**
- This method does not return any data; it’s a `void` return type because the primary goal is to delete the employee.

#### **(@PutMapping("/{empId}")) Method:**
```java
@PutMapping("/{empId}")
public Employee updateEmployee(@PathVariable Long empId, @RequestBody Employee employeeDetails) {
    Optional<Employee> optionalEmployee = employeeService.getEmployeeById(empId);

    if (optionalEmployee.isPresent()) {
        Employee existingEmployee = optionalEmployee.get();
        existingEmployee.setName(employeeDetails.getName());
        existingEmployee.setDate(employeeDetails.getDate());
        existingEmployee.setAddress(employeeDetails.getAddress());

        return employeeService.saveEmployee(existingEmployee);
    } else {
        // Return null or throw an exception if employee not found
        return null; // You can handle it as per your requirement
    }
}

```
Certainly! Here's the explanation in Markdown format:

---

#### **Purpose:**
This endpoint is designed to update an employee’s details by their employee ID. The employee data to be updated is sent in the request body.

#### **@PutMapping("/{empId}")**:
- The `@PutMapping` annotation maps HTTP PUT requests to this method.
- The `{empId}` part of the URL is a path variable that represents the employee's unique ID.

#### **@PathVariable Long empId**:
- This gets the employee ID from the URL to identify the employee that is to be updated.

#### **@RequestBody Employee employeeDetails**:
- The employee data that needs to be updated is passed in the request body as a JSON object.
- This annotation binds the incoming JSON data to the `employeeDetails` parameter.

#### **Method:**
1. The method first calls `employeeService.getEmployeeById(empId)` to check if the employee with the provided ID exists.
2. If the employee exists (`optionalEmployee.isPresent()` is true):
   - It retrieves the employee object and updates fields such as `name`, `date`, and `address` based on the `employeeDetails` provided in the request body.
   - After updating the fields, the employee object is saved back to the database using `employeeService.saveEmployee(existingEmployee)`.
   
#### **Return Type:**
- The method returns the updated `Employee` object, which will be sent back to the client as a response.

#### **Handling Non-Existent Employee:**
- If the employee with the provided ID doesn't exist (`optionalEmployee.isPresent()` is false), the method will return `null`.
- You can modify this behavior to throw a specific exception (such as `EmployeeNotFoundException`) or handle it differently based on your requirements.

#### 4. Exception Handling
- In the `addEmployee` method, if a `RuntimeException` occurs while adding the employee, it is caught in the catch block, and a response with `HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST` (400) is returned. This is basic error handling to inform the client that there was an issue with the request.

Certainly! Below is the **summary of endpoints** and **key points** in markdown format:

---

## **Summary of Endpoints**

#### **1. GET /api/employee/{empId}** - Get an Employee by ID

- **Purpose**: This endpoint is designed to retrieve an employee’s details based on their unique employee ID.
- **Request**: The `empId` is passed as a path variable in the URL.
- **Logic**: 
  - It calls the `getEmployeeById(empId)` method in the `EmployeeService` to fetch the employee data from the database.
  - Returns an `Optional<Employee>`, which will contain the employee data if found, or be empty if no employee exists with that ID.
  
---

#### **2. GET /api/employee** - Get All Employees

- **Purpose**: This endpoint is designed to retrieve a list of all employees from the database.
- **Request**: This is a simple GET request without any path variables.
- **Logic**: 
  - It calls the `getAllEmployees()` method in the `EmployeeService` to fetch all employee records.
  - Returns an `Iterable<Employee>`, which represents a collection of all employee records in the database.

---

#### **3. DELETE /api/employee/{empId}** - Delete an Employee by ID

- **Purpose**: This endpoint is designed to delete an employee from the database using their employee ID.
- **Request**: The `empId` is passed as a path variable in the URL.
- **Logic**: 
  - It calls the `deleteEmployee(empId)` method in the `EmployeeService` to delete the employee with the given ID from the database.
  - This method does not return any data (void method) since the operation is simply to delete the employee.

---

#### **4. PUT /api/employee/{empId}** - Update an Employee by ID

- **Purpose**: This endpoint is designed to update an employee’s details by their employee ID. The employee data to be updated is sent in the request body.
- **Request**: 
  - The `empId` is passed as a path variable to identify the employee.
  - The updated employee data is provided in the request body (`@RequestBody Employee employeeDetails`).
  
- **Logic**:
  - It first checks if the employee with the given `empId` exists using the `getEmployeeById(empId)` method.
  - If the employee exists, it updates the relevant fields (like `name`, `date`, `address`, etc.) with the data provided in the request body.
  - The updated employee data is then saved back to the database using the `saveEmployee(existingEmployee)` method.
  - If the employee does not exist, the method returns `null` (you can handle it with custom error handling or exceptions if needed).

---

#### **Key Points:**

1. **@GetMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping**:
   - These annotations are used to map HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) to Java methods in the controller.
   - They allow the API to handle different types of requests like retrieving data, updating records, and deleting resources.

2. **Path Variables (@PathVariable)**:
   - The `@PathVariable` annotation allows extracting values from the URL path.
   - For example, `{empId}` in the URL is captured and passed as a method parameter to identify a specific employee.

3. **Request Body (@RequestBody)**:
   - The `@RequestBody` annotation binds the incoming JSON data to a Java object.
   - In the `PUT` endpoint, the `employeeDetails` object is populated from the request body to update the employee data.

4. **Service Layer Interaction**:
   - The controller communicates with the `EmployeeService` layer for business logic like fetching, updating, or deleting employee records from the database.
   - Methods like `getEmployeeById()`, `getAllEmployees()`, `deleteEmployee()`, and `saveEmployee()` are invoked to interact with the database.

5. **Response Handling**:
   - The controller does not explicitly return HTTP status codes (other than in `POST` methods) but relies on the service methods to perform the necessary operations (CRUD operations).
   - For `GET` requests, the return type is `Optional<Employee>` (for single employee retrieval) or `Iterable<Employee>` (for all employees). For `DELETE` and `PUT`, the methods typically return `void` or a modified employee object.

6. **Optional Return Type**:
   - In the `GET` methods, `Optional<Employee>` is used to handle the case where an employee may not be found, ensuring no `NullPointerExceptions` occur.
   - In the `PUT` method, if the employee does not exist, the method returns `null` (though it can be modified to throw an exception or handle it differently).

7. **Void Return for Delete**:
   - The `DELETE` method returns `void` because the action is completed without returning any data, indicating a successful deletion.

#### **Key Advantages of MySQL in Recruiters Gear**

- **Speed and Responsiveness**: Ensures quick data retrieval, which is essential for real-time user interactions like job searching or candidate matching.
- **Structured Data Storage**: The relational model of MySQL is perfect for managing recruiter-candidate relationships and job-related information.
- **Ease of Backup and Restoration**: Regular backups are simple with MySQL, ensuring the safety of critical data.
- **Future Scalability**: As Recruiters Gear grows, MySQL's ability to handle more users, more data, and more transactions ensures that it remains a robust choice.

#### 🏛️ **MySQL Database Architecture**

#### 1) Database Design
- **Schema Overview**: The MySQL database is organized into multiple schemas representing different modules of the application (e.g., users, orders, transactions, products).
- **Tables**: The database consists of relational tables that store structured data for various entities such as users, orders, payments, etc.
- **Normalization**: The database schema is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data consistency and minimize redundancy.
- **Indexes**: Indexes are created on frequently queried columns to optimize performance. For example, an index on the `user_id` column in the users table and on the `transaction_date` column in the transactions table.
- **Foreign Keys**: Relationships between tables are established through foreign keys. For example, `order_id` in the `order_items` table is a foreign key that references `orders.order_id`.

#### 2) Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
- An ER diagram visually represents the database entities and their relationships.
  - **Entities**: Users, Products, Orders, Payments, etc.
  - **Relationships**: A user can place many orders, each order can have many products, and each order can have many payments.

#### 3) Data Flow
- **Data Insertion**: Data is inserted into the database via application APIs or batch processes. For example, a new user registers through the application and the users table is populated with their details.
- **Data Access Patterns**: Common queries include retrieving a user's order history, fetching payment details, and listing products.
- **Data Transformation**: Data transformations, such as currency conversion for payments or discount calculations for products, occur in the application layer before storing or displaying data.

#### 4) Storage Engine
- **InnoDB Storage Engine**: The primary storage engine for the database is InnoDB, providing full ACID compliance for transactions, foreign key constraints, and row-level locking for concurrent transactions.
- **MyISAM**: For certain tables requiring fast read operations and where transactions are not critical, MyISAM is used.

#### 5) Security
- **Authentication**: Users are authenticated via username and password. Passwords are stored using bcrypt hashing.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is applied, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions like adding data or querying sensitive tables.
- **Encryption**: SSL/TLS encryption is enforced for secure communication between the database and the application. Sensitive data such as credit card information is encrypted using AES-256.

#### 6) Backup and Recovery
- **Backup Strategy**: The database is backed up every night using `mysqldump` for full backups and `Percona XtraBackup` for incremental backups.
- **Recovery Plan**: In case of failure, backups are restored to the previous day's state, and recovery is monitored through automated tools. Recovery procedures also include rebuilding indexes and re-importing any missing transactional data.

#### 7) Performance Optimization
- **Indexing**: Indexes are applied on frequently queried columns, such as `email` in the users table, `order_date` in the orders table, and `product_id` in the order_items table.
- **Query Caching**: Query caching is enabled for read-heavy operations to reduce database load.
- **Partitioning**: Large tables, such as the orders table, are partitioned by `order_date` to improve query performance and manage data more effectively.
- **Replication**: MySQL master-slave replication is set up for scaling read operations, with the master server handling writes and slave servers handling read queries.

#### 8) Scalability and High Availability
- **Replication**: MySQL replication is used to ensure high availability and distribute read traffic across multiple servers.
- **Sharding**: For very large datasets, horizontal sharding is employed to distribute data across multiple database servers.
- **Clustering**: MySQL Cluster is used to provide automatic failover, ensuring continued service availability during server failure.

#### 9) Monitoring and Logging
- **MySQL Performance Schema**: The MySQL Performance Schema is enabled to collect detailed statistics on queries, events, and database operations to identify slow queries and potential bottlenecks.
- **Error Logs**: The MySQL error log captures critical errors and issues such as crashes or failed transactions.
- **Query Logs**: All database queries are logged for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Tools such as **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used for real-time monitoring of database health and performance metrics.

#### 10) Version Control and Updates
- **Schema Versioning**: Schema changes are tracked using **Liquibase** for version control. This allows smooth transitions between versions and minimizes errors during updates.
- **Update Procedures**: When updating MySQL or applying schema changes, a backup is always taken first, and changes are applied in a staging environment before being pushed to production.

#### 11) Integration with Other Systems
- **APIs**: The MySQL database is integrated with **REST APIs**, allowing other systems to interact with the data (e.g., mobile applications, admin dashboards).
- **Third-party Tools**: The system integrates with reporting tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI** for real-time analytics.

#### 🗃️ **Database Connection Information**

#### 1) Database Host:
- **Host**: `localhost` or the IP address of the server hosting the database.
- **Port**: `3306` (default MySQL port).

#### 2) Connection Credentials:
- **Username**: `your_database_username`.
- **Password**: `your_secure_password`.
- **Database Name**: `your_database_name`.

#### 3) JDBC URL:
- The JDBC URL is the connection string used by the Spring Boot application to connect to the MySQL database.
```java
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
```
#### 4) Connection Pooling:
**HikariCP** (default in Spring Boot) is used for database connection pooling.

#### Configuration in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=your_database_user
spring.datasource.password=your_secure_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=30000
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
```

#### 5) SSL/TLS Configuration:
If SSL is enabled for secure communication, you may need additional parameters.

#### Example:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name?useSSL=true&requireSSL=true
```

#### 6) Database Configuration in `application.properties`:
Here’s an example configuration for connecting to MySQL with Spring Boot:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/recruiters_gear?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=root

spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
```

#### 7) Database Connection Testing:
You can test the database connection through a simple test class in Spring Boot:

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class DatabaseConnectionTest {

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Test
    public void testConnection() throws SQLException {
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            assertNotNull(connection);
        }
    }
}
```

### 📊 Data Types and Constraints Used in MySQL:
#### 📝 Tabular Format (Recommended):
To provide a clear overview of the database schema, a tabular format is used to detail the columns, their data types, constraints, and descriptions for each table in the database. This structure helps developers quickly understand the database design and relationships between tables.

#### Table: `employee`

3. **Stress Testing:**
   
   - Pushes the system beyond its capacity to determine how it behaves under extreme conditions (e.g., excessive load, high traffic).
   - Helps identify how the application fails and recovers under stress.

5. **Scalability Testing:**
   
   - Assesses how well the application scales with increased load or data.
   - Useful for planning resource allocation and identifying points where performance degrades.

7. **Functional Testing:**
   
   - Verifies the application's basic functionality under load conditions to ensure the business-critical features are not affected by performance issues.

9. **Distributed Testing:**
   - JMeter allows the distribution of test loads across multiple machines, simulating high traffic scenarios that can’t be replicated on a single machine.

#### Steps for Performance Testing with JMeter:

1. **Install and Set Up JMeter:**
   
   - Download and install Apache JMeter.
   - Set up the necessary environment (Java, JMeter, etc.).

3. **Create a Test Plan:**
   
   - Define the **Test Plan** in JMeter, which outlines the test's execution flow, including thread groups (simulated users), HTTP requests, and listeners.
   - **Thread Group**: Defines the number of virtual users and the behavior (e.g., ramp-up time, loops).
   - **Samplers**: Used to simulate HTTP requests, database queries, etc.

5. **Define HTTP Requests:**
   
   - Set up requests for the resources you want to test, such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.
   - Specify the server URL, parameters, and headers.

7. **Add Listeners:**
   
   - Listeners capture and display results from the test, such as response times, throughput, and error rates.
   - Common listeners include **Graph Results**, **Summary Report**, and **View Results Tree**.

9. **Run the Test:**
    
   - Execute the test plan, simulating the desired load.
   - JMeter will send requests and capture the responses during the test.

11. **Analyze Results:**
    
   - Review the performance metrics like **response times**, **throughput**, **error rates**, and **latency**.
   - Identify performance bottlenecks, issues with server capacity, or resource limitations.

#### Key Performance Metrics in JMeter:

- **Response Time:** The time taken for the server to respond to a request.
- **Throughput:** The number of requests processed per unit of time (requests/sec).
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests during the test.
- **Latency:** The time taken for a request to travel from the client to the server and back.
